3. **Run the app:** `flutter run`
4. **Test authentication flow** with phone numbers

### Firebase Authentication Testing:
Use these test phone numbers configured in Firebase Console:
- `+1 234 567 8901` → SMS Code: `123456`
- `+91 9876543210` → SMS Code: `654321`  
- `+44 7700 900123` → SMS Code: `999999`

### Optional Improvements:
1. Configure production Firebase project
2. Fix Visual Studio installation (Windows app development)
3. Resolve test file errors (for testing suite)
4. Update deprecated APIs (non-critical)
